# UrlDataParser
Simple project to fetch a web page and parse the result to something useful

To run it:

npm install  
node -r babel-register index.js  
open webpage @ localhost:3000  
hit go!  

The current implementation is hardcoded to parse the various pages listed under https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_UN_numbers and parse them into a text that is useable by a Commercial Software Application. This code can at best be used as an example on how to perform such an action but is not meant as a general use application in the current state.
